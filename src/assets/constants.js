     `Hello! My name is Sathish. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and I'm currently expanding my skill set by learning Full Stack Development from Guvi IIT Madras.`,
 
    ` I have hands-on experience as a Full Stack Developer, where I've had the opportunity to work on various projects that allowed me to apply and enhance my coding skills. My mechanical engineering background gives me a unique perspective in problem-solving and attention to detail, which I apply in coding scenarios.`,
 
    ` I'm eager to join a team where I can contribute my skills as a developer and continue to learn and grow in this field. I strongly believe in the transformative power of technology to solve problems and improve lives, and I'm excited to be part of that journey.
